# ⚠️ This Project Is No Longer Supported! ⚠️
Thank you all for using Vengeance, but while I have the ability to unblock the entire program right now, I'm not going too. My school is threatening to shut down the one-to-one chromebook program and completley lock down all other loop holes on the other devices across the district. I have insider info and I know that they're aren't bluffing. They can patch every single loophole, yet they choose not to for the sake of teachers losing tools for education. If I continue to exploit these loopholes, many elective classes and clubs across the district will cease to exist while normal classes will lose many important tools. I advise anyone looking for loopholes to stop and think about the consequences. I'm done with loopholes and I'm leaving the community. I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't.

# Vengeance
The **New** Ultimate Bookmarklet!

An addon to [Avo](https://github.com/FogNetwork/Avo) and the successor to [avo-ultimate](https://github.com/Browncha023/avo-ultimate)

A new favlet featuring unblocked dev tools, games, and more!

## Installation & Updating
1. Show your bookmarks bar with `ctrl + shift + b`

2. Right click on the bar and choose `Add Page` (If you're updating right click your old bookmark and select `Edit`)

3. Set the name to `Vengeance` and the URL to the code below:

```js
javascript:(function () {var v = document.createElement('script');v.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/niccc69/Vengeance-main@v1.1/script.min.js';document.body.appendChild(v);}())
```

### Features
- Unblocked dev tools including an improved edit function
- A game hub featuring 10 fun games to mess around with
- vGBA: A port of IodineGBA to play GBA games (Coming Soon...)
- Tab specific saving for games (Site-based)
- Several different other functions to utilize
- An update function and future update roadmap
- Can't be blocked by the school by using several different tactics
- And a revamped UI

### Troubleshooting
- First of all, bookmarlets are not supported on all sites
- Second of all, the bookmarklet may appear slightly different on certain sites due to CSS rules
- If the bookmarklet is not working on any sites and you are part of `Alpine School District`, it means that the IT team has somehow figured out a new way to block it. If so, come back here and new code should be ready, if not wait a little while and come back. The README will confirm that there is new code
- If you have a problem with something else such as the games not working anywhere, contact me @ browncha023@alpinsd.org (For `Alpine School District`) or @ cjbrown402@gmail.com (For `Other`)

#### Update Roadmap:
- Rewrite Main Source (Coming 3.0+)

**Roadmap subject to change!*
